          <h3>What is Android?</h3>
          <p>
            The answer is as usual <strong>"Android is a mobile operating system."</strong> or <strong>"Android is a
              mobile operating system
              based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for
              touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets."</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Android is a open source free software, which is developed by an association of developers known as
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Handset_Alliance">Handset Alliance (OHA)</a>, which is sponsered
            by GOOGLE.

          </p>

          <p>
            The source code of this project is known as Android Open Source Project (AOSP). This Android devices comes
            with some pre-installed
            softwares like mobile services, core gapps such as Chrome, Google Playstore and some applications associated
            to Google Play Services.<br>
            As this is an open source project there are millions of and Android developers around the world including
            Android application development.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">History of Android</h2>

          <p>
            In October 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White founded Android lnc. in Palo Alto,
            California.
            <br>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <b>
                Did You known that Android's first intention was to develope an advanced operating system for Digital
                Cameras.
              </b>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            Then what made them to switch their aim from Camera OS to OS for Phones.
            Lets check out,<br><br>
            At that time (2005) the two mobile OS developers Symbian and Microsoft Windows Phone were catching the
            market.
            But this OS lack in security of the user, Symbian OS was completely depended on Nokia devices. Nokia the
            creator of Symbia OS
            which was not an open source software unfortunately had to see their graph going down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where as the Windows phones did not get apps support due to fewer apps in Store. OS lacked in responsive and
            get hanged often.
            Many of Windows phone device get bricked when you try to update it.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Google, the team led by Rubin developed a
            mobile device platform powered by the Linux kernel. Google marketed the platform to handset makers and
            carriers on the promise of providing a flexible, upgradeable system and also as to it is open source the
            developers showed
            their interest. As the Android got support from Google and its services, it started catching up market
            within a very short span
            of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The First ever device that launched with Android is HTC Dream.

              style="height: 200px; width: 400px;"><br>
            HTC Dream
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Hardware</h2>

          <p>
            Ok enough of history, lets get to some hardware part of Android.<br>
            As this OS is build up on Linux, hardware is one of the important part. The main hardware platform for
            Android is ARM (the ARMv7 and ARMv8-A architectures), with x86 and x86-64 architectures also officially
            supported in later versions of Android.<br>
            <img src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/4144/2X-9924-2.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"><br>
            Camera a hardware part of a device
          </p>

          <p>
            Android devices incorporate many optional hardware components, including still or video cameras, GPS,
            orientation sensors, dedicated gaming controls, accelerometers, gyroscopes, barometers, magnetometers,
            proximity sensors, pressure sensors, thermometers, and touchscreens.
          </p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <b>
              Did You known why all the Android versions are named after desserts?<br>
            </b>
            Each major release is named in alphabetical order after a dessert or sugary treat, with the first few
            Android versions being called "Cupcake", "Donut", "Eclair", and "Froyo", in that order. During its
            announcement of Android KitKat in 2013, Google explained that "Since these devices make our lives so
            sweet,
            each Android version is named after a dessert",

          </blockquote>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Development</h2>
          <p>
            Android is developed by Google until the latest changes and updates are ready to be released, at which point
            the source code is made available to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), an open source initiative
            led by Google. The AOSP code can be found without modification on select devices, mainly the Google
            Nexus and Google Pixel series of devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically the Stock OS in every device is same, the changes in the UI and hardware
            differ from device to devices, as per the device manufacturer designs. Let me give you an example of it,
            suppose you have
            a device a dual rear cameras and on the other hand your friend has a device with single rear camera, so here
            there is
            difference in hardware components but your both devices run on Android 9 Pie.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Device Codenames</h2>
          <p>
            Internally, Android identifies each supported device by its device codename, a short string, which may
            or may not be similar to the model name used in marketing the device. For example, the device codename of
            the Pixel smartphone is sailfish.<br>
            <a href="https://www.droidviews.com/list-of-android-device-codenames/">Want to know whats your device
              codename.</a><br>
            Install adb in your PC and type command "adb pull /system/build.prop".
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Recents</h2>

          <p>
            Most of the Android Devices are running on Android 10 stable.
            Recently the Android has released its beta of the latest Android 11 in the Pixel devices.<br>
